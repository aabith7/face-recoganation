# face-recoganation
This project implements a face detection system leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with OpenCV. I collected a dataset of facial images and preprocessed the data, converting it into arrays suitable for training the model. The KNN algorithm is utilized to classify and detect faces in real-time.
